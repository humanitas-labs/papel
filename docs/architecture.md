# Paper — Architecture

Last updated: `2026.08.31`

> Paper is a native macOS editor for ordinary UTF-8 Markdown files. The file is the only persistent document state. Rendering, configuration, and window state remain outside it.

## 1. System boundaries

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `MarkdownDocument` | Decode and encode the source without transforming it |
| `PaperApp` | Own scenes, commands, and the native document lifecycle |
| `MarkdownEditor` | Bridge the SwiftUI document binding into AppKit |
| `PaperTextView` | Provide editing behavior and draw page decorations |
| `MarkdownSyntaxStyler` | Add temporary presentation attributes to the source |
| `PaperLayoutManager` | Conceal or substitute glyphs without changing storage |
| `ConfigurationStore` | Load, write, and watch user settings and presets |
| `Appearance` | Resolve configuration into fonts, spacing, and colours |

SwiftUI owns application composition. AppKit and TextKit 1 own the writing surface. The boundary between them is `MarkdownEditor`, an `NSViewRepresentable` that synchronizes plain text and the document URL.

## 2. Editor pipeline

```text
Markdown file
    ↕
MarkdownDocument
    ↕ SwiftUI binding
MarkdownEditor
    ↕
PaperTextView + MarkdownSyntaxStyler + PaperLayoutManager
```

The styler replaces presentation attributes across the in-memory text storage, then annotates recognized Markdown constructs. It does not replace source characters. Restyling waits while an input method holds marked text.

`PaperLayoutManager` turns concealed punctuation into zero-advance control glyphs outside the selected paragraphs. Glyph substitution renders list markers and arrows without editing their source characters. `PaperTextView` draws block quotes, code blocks, thematic breaks, inline-code chips, placeholders, and images around the laid-out text.

Block images use paragraph spacing to reserve a stable drawing band below the source line. The source remains present for selection, undo, copy, find, and saving. Local images are decoded through `ImageStore`, downsampled for display, cached for the session, and watched for changes on disk.

## 3. Invariants and configuration

- Saving must preserve the Markdown source exactly.
- Styling, concealment, substitution, and image rendering must not mutate the source string.
- Revealing syntax may change horizontal positions but must not change line or document height.
- Relative resources resolve from the saved Markdown file. Unsaved documents have no relative filesystem base.
- Opening a document must not fetch remote media automatically.
- The configuration file is the source of truth for user-tunable appearance values.

`ConfigurationStore` reads `key = value` settings from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/paper/config` or `~/.config/paper/config`. It preserves comments and unknown keys when writing, watches in-place and atomic saves, and posts a notification when effective values change. Presets use the same format in the adjacent `presets/` directory.
